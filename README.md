## 🌟 Why This Project?  
Energy is at the **heart of global development** 🌍.  
This project analyzes **production, consumption, GDP, emissions, and population** across countries to answer:  

✔ Which countries consume the most energy?  
✔ How is GDP growth linked to energy usage?  
✔ What role does population play in emissions?  
✔ Are major economies leading or lagging in sustainability?

## ✨ Highlights of the Project  
- 🔍 **16 Key SQL Queries** covering emissions, GDP, population, and energy insights.  
- 📊 **ER Diagram & Structured Database** for efficient analysis.  
- 🌱 **Business insights & recommendations** for sustainable energy use.  
- 🧠 **Real-world problem-solving** using SQL joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

## 🗂️ Database Schema (ERD)  
- **Country** – Central table connecting all others.  
- **Emission, Consumption, Production** – Store energy and environmental data.  
- **GDP** – Yearly economic values of each country.  
- **Population** – Yearly population data.  
- All tables are linked by **country** and **year** for easy comparison.

## 🔎 Key SQL Queries & Analysis  
1. Total emissions per country (latest year).  
2. Top 5 countries by GDP.  
3. Compare energy production vs. consumption by year and country.  
4. Energy types contributing most to emissions (fossil fuels vs. renewables).  
5. Year-over-year change in global emissions.  
6. GDP trends across countries.  
7. Impact of population growth on emissions.  
8. Energy consumption trends in major economies.  
9. Yearly change in emissions per capita.  
10. Emission-to-GDP ratio by country.  
11. Energy consumption per capita (last decade).  
12. Energy production per capita across countries.  
13. Countries with highest energy consumption relative to GDP.  
14. Top 10 countries by population vs. emissions.  
15. Global share (%) of emissions by country.  
16. Global average GDP, emissions, and population by year.

## 📊 Final Business Insights  
- High emissions are directly linked with top energy-consuming countries.  
- **GDP growth** strongly correlates with **energy production & consumption**.  
- **Per capita analysis** shows unequal energy and emission distribution.  
- Major economies **drive global energy & emission trends**.  

---

## 💡 Key Recommendations  
- **Invest in renewable energy** to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.  
- Implement **energy efficiency policies** to lower emissions without slowing GDP growth.  
- Focus on **sustainable development strategies** in major economies.  
- Monitor **per capita trends** to ensure fair & balanced global energy use.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
This project analyzed **global energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP, and population** using SQL. It showed how:  
- Energy consumption & production patterns vary by country.  
- GDP and population growth impact emissions.  
- Sustainable energy management is needed to balance **economic growth** and **environmental impact**.  

---

## 🚀 Challenges Faced  
- Writing efficient queries with multiple **JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregations**.  
- Structuring queries to extract **meaningful insights**.  
- Improved skills in **SQL filtering, query optimization, and real-world analysis**.
